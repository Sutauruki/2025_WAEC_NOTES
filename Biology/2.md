**ðŸ“š Extra WAEC-Style Questions & Tasks for Each Specimen**  
*(No fluff, just what examiners love to ask!)*  

---

### **1. Bean Weevil**  
- **Q:** Why are bean weevils classified as *insects*?  
  **A:** 3 body parts (head, thorax, abdomen), 3 pairs of legs.  
- **Q:** How does metamorphosis make bean weevils successful pests?  
  **A:** Larvae live inside beans (hidden from pesticides).  

---

### **2. Bean Seed**  
- **Experiment Task:** Soak bean seed, dissect to show **cotyledons** and **embryo**.  
- **Q:** What test confirms stored food in the cotyledon?  
  **A:** **Iodine** test (starch â†’ blue-black) or **Biuret** (protein â†’ purple).  
- **Q:** Why is the seed coat important?  
  **A:** Protects embryo, regulates water uptake for germination.  

---

### **3. Waterleaf Plant**  
- **Q:** How is the leaf adapted for photosynthesis?  
  **A:** Broad lamina (maximize light), thin (short gas diffusion).  
- **Q:** Why is axile placentation visible in its capsule fruit?  
  **A:** Ovules attached to central axis (cut fruit to observe).  

---

### **4. Quill Feather**  
- **Q:** How does the structure aid flight?  
  **A:** Hollow shaft (lightweight), barbs with hooks (interlock for strength).  
- **Task:** Draw and label **rachis, barbs, barbules**.  

---

### **5. Pineapple (LS)**  
- **Q:** Why is it a *multiple fruit*?  
  **A:** Forms from fused ovaries of many flowers.  
- **Q:** How do monocot features appear in its leaves?  
  **A:** Parallel veins, fibrous roots (visible in LS).  

---

### **6. Orange Fruit**  
- **Q:** How is the rind an adaptation?  
  **A:** Leathery (protects seeds), contains oils (repel pests).  
- **Task:** Compare orange (hesperidium) vs. tomato (berry).  

---

### **7. Raw Egg**  
- **Q:** Which part stores nutrients for the embryo?  
  **A:** **Yolk** (proteins, fats) and **albumen** (water, protein).  
- **Q:** How does the shell aid survival?  
  **A:** Calcium carbonate (protection, gas exchange pores).  

---

### **8. Test Tube (Water)**  
- **Experiment:** Use it as a **control** in testing water content in seeds.  
- **Task:** Describe steps to test if a seed releases water during germination.  

---

### **9. Boiled Egg**  
- **Q:** Why doesnâ€™t the boiled egg hatch?  
  **A:** High heat denatures proteins (kills embryo).  
- **Task:** Compare raw vs. boiled egg under a hand lens (texture, color).  

---

### **Apparatus-Based Questions**  
- **Plastic Syringe:** Measure 2ml of NaOH for Biuret test.  
- **Bunsen Burner:** Boil egg to denature proteins (explain process).  
- **Hand Lens:** Observe reticulate venation in bean leaves.

| **Venation**          | Reticulate          | Parallel            |  

| **Fruit Type**        | **Orange**          | **Pineapple**       |  
|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|  
| **Structure**         | Hesperidium         | Multiple fruit      |  
| **Seed Dispersal**    | Animals (eating)    | Animals (eating)    |

### **WAECâ€™s Favourite Tricky Questions**  
1. **Q:** Why is a boiled egg used in experiments instead of raw?  
   **A:** Denatured proteins wonâ€™t react (e.g., no coagulation in heat tests).  
2. **Q:** If you remove the quill featherâ€™s barbules, what happens?  
   **A:** Feather loses shape â†’ disrupts flight.  
3. **Q:** Which specimen has *axile placentation*? **A:** Waterleaf, pineapple, orange.

### **Quick Mnemonics**  
- **Fruit Types:**  
  - **Hesperidium** = "**HES** (heavenly citrus) **PER**fect for oranges!"  
  - **Legume** = "**LEG**ume splits into two **LEG**s!"  
- **Germination:**  
  - **Epigeal** = "**E**levate cotyledons **Above** ground!"
